**DRAFT #1.0**

**Welcome**

Weâ€™re thrilled to welcome you to the MAGFest family. The MAGFam is a spunky tribe of vast and mighty adventurers. MAGFest events are behemoth hydras that only the bravest would ever try to tame. Our volunteers are legendary: together, we journey to the breach, forge legendary bonds, and return to our homes with epic tales. 

	The best parts of MAGFest come from our volunteersâ€™ brilliant minds. Each and every one of our events is built by people like you. Together we pitch crazy ideas and then rally together to build our dreams into reality.

We canâ€™t wait to get started.

**Mission:**

  

Make the world a better place through video games

There are many different and totally valid ways to accomplish this mission, with our primary method being preserving video game music, history, art, and culture though events.  The **core values** define the specific and weird ways that MAGFest INC does it.  Other organizations may do things different and create the same end result, and this is OK.  The core values are guiding principles which, without them, MAGFest isnâ€™t worth doing and we should close up shop.  Core values also represent a deliberate prioritization of one valid course of action vs another equally valid course of action.

**Core Values**

* Sincerity

    * Our events authentically showcase our passions.

    * We want to attract people who share our interests.

    * Enthusiasm takes precedence over mass appeal.

* Support

    * Demonstrate a genuine desire for the success of everyone around you.

    * Actively contribute to the growth youâ€™d like to see in your peers and the organization.

    * Exercise candor as a form of respect with empathy

    * Be upfront, be real and authentic with yourself and with others.

* Participation

    * Own your experience: create what you want to see at the event.

    * If youâ€™ve got a great idea, weâ€™ll give you the support needed to make it happen.

    * Break down barriers between attendees, staff, and guests, allowing everyone to participate in their own way.

* Experimentation

    * Failure is a necessary step in growth and development.

    * Donâ€™t be afraid to try to create new things.

    * Mistakes made while acting in good faith should not be punished.

* Community

    * Everything we create is for our community of players, creatives, and friends.

    * We donâ€™t just create events -- we nurture and build communities.

    * Sponsorships should be partnerships that benefit the community

**Guidelines**

* Know your limits and remain honest with yourself and others. Take care of yourself, your body, and your mind. If youâ€™ve been given more than you can handle, let us know. Weâ€™re here to help.

* Events can be hectic. Itâ€™s important to try to keep calm, remember the bigger picture, and de-escalate. Try not to sweat the small stuff -- every event is practice for the next and practice makes perfect.

* Each position, person, and shift is important. We couldnâ€™t put together our events without each and every one of you. Thank you.

* This may seem obvious, but donâ€™t do illegal things.

**Responsibilities**

Volunteers are expected to adhere to both the volunteer and [attendee Code of Conduct](http://super.magfest.org/codeofconduct/).

* Conflict Management: Volunteers should nurture a safe and friendly environment. Personality conflicts may be inevitable in stressful situations but they never impede teamwork. Disagreeing with ideas is acceptable within reason, but volunteers never attack people. If you encounter a problem, be sure to contact your department head. Disagree with the idea, not the person.

* Punctuality: Volunteers remain punctual before, during, or after an event by filling out the volunteer checklist, arriving on time for shifts, and completing any shift reviews after the event. Should anything come up, please inform your department head so that we can work with you.

* Equipment: Volunteers are entrusted with valuable equipment (e.g., arcade cabinets, contractor equipment, A/V gear.) Please be careful and respectful of this equipment by only using it only in the method requested. Do your best to prevent any damage.

* Staff Shirts: When you wear your staff shirt, you are signaling that you are available to help attendees. If youâ€™re not interested in helping, please change shirts.

* Communication Tools: Volunteers receive access to internal staff newsletter, our internal database Uber, as well as our volunteer Slack and Twine groups.

    * Volunteers are expected to utilize Uber to complete their volunteer checklist in a timely fashion. 

**Policies**

Listed below are various volunteer policies. If you have any questions, please reach out to your department head or to [Staffing Operations](mailto:stops@magfest.org), whichever is more appropriate. 

**Missing Shifts**

* We understand that sometimes circumstances beyond our control may come up. If you are no longer able to make it to your scheduled shift(s), please inform your department head as soon as youâ€™re able. Itâ€™s helpful to remove the shifts from your schedule in Uber so that other people can sign up for them.

* If you need access to different types of shifts or shifts on a different day, please contact [STOPs](mailto:stops@magfest.org) so that we can accomodate you.

**Department Assignments**

* Whenever possible, Staffing Operations will assign you to your preferred departments. Some departments are closed and require department head approval to be assigned. In these cases, STOPs will facilitate conversations between the staffer and department heads to see if an assignment can be made. 

**Weighted Shifts**

* Some shifts may have weighted hours to encourage sign-ups. Historically, this is to encourage shift sign-ups that are traditionally understaffed. Weighted hours determine your staffing perks. For example, if a staffer has worked 15 actual hours at a 2.0 weight for a total of 30 weighted hours, they will be considered eligible for staff hotel space in addition to all of the other lower perks.

**Out of Event Hours**

* Volunteers may receive additional opportunities to work for MAGFest *outside of the event*. Volunteer hours are considered outside of event if they are two weeks away from the start of the event or end of the event. These opportunities include preparations at the warehouse, promotional work, and more. Unless specified by a department head, time volunteered outside of event is utilized at half-cost (i.e., 0.5x hour weight). Outside of event hours count towards staffing perks for the event theyâ€™re working for.

* For promotional work, volunteers may choose between:

    * having their badge and/or hotel space purchased by MAGFest

    * utilizing time volunteered as out of event hours. 

**Reimbursements**

* Staffers may occasionally need to make purchases for their department or shift. In these cases, reimbursements will be made.

* You can find a detailed [reimbursement policy here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LsIH5_iEHl6AhGeRHcRmEs-iK8yLynQDkpDHkJ_-Qw0/edit)

**Sensitive Information Access**

2017 version: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/13yxeCUNxYx6OnKnxMW5iXKbU-9r6QBfAyVSNgkWH-_M/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13yxeCUNxYx6OnKnxMW5iXKbU-9r6QBfAyVSNgkWH-_M/edit)

* Your volunteer duties may include receiving access to sensitive information via Uber, Mailchimp, or more. This access is granted only to fulfill your assignments. Refrain from using it for personal or malicious reasons.

**Charitable Contributions**

* MAGFest is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit non-stock corporation. Staffers who have made donations (e.g. technical equipment, food stuffs, airfare) may be able to deduct its value on their tax forms. We are not able to determine the value of these donated contributions. Amazon smile.

* If you would like a donation receipt for your contributions, please email [stops@magfest.org](mailto:stops@magfest.org) with: 

    * a list of your donations

    * the dates we received them

    * the estimated value of the donations.

**Employer Volunteer Benefits**

* Some employers offer voluntary benefits to their employees. Each program is different, but several common practices include paid leave for approved hours or sending monetary donations to MAGFest Inc based on the hours an employee volunteers.

* If your employer has a volunteer program youâ€™d like to utilize, weâ€™d be grateful and honored to help. Weâ€™re happy to provide you with any documentation youâ€™d need. Please email [stops@magfest.org](mailto:stops@magfest.org) with your requirements.

**Exit Interview**

* We understand that sometimes priorities change and that you may leave your volunteer position at MAGFest. In these cases, if youâ€™re interested, weâ€™d appreciate the opportunity to chat about your time with us. 

* Weâ€™d value your feedback and the chance to improve the volunteer experience for everyone. No matter what, we thank you for giving us your time. 

**Staff Reporting**

* If you encounter a problem, we have teams ready to help. Please email [staffreports@magfest.org](mailto:staffreports@magfest.org) for any concerns or assistance.

* Each circumstance is different but we have a variety of resources available to support you. Please consider the following list when you are ready to ask for help:

    * On-site Security

    * [Slack Moderators](mailto:mods@magfest.org)

    * [Staffing Operations](mailto:stops@magfest.org)

    * Anonymous Reporting Form

    * [Offsite Security](mailto:security@magfest.org)

    * [Staff Reporting](mailto:staffreports@magfest.org)

* If youâ€™d like to familiarize yourself with our reporting process, please read it here.

**Communications ****Code of Conduct**

Volunteers that utilize internal MAGFest communication forums including Slack, IRC, or Twine must abide by our [communications code of conduct.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WcRjehNFF0CQHgqhCn-tGDuwp7pa0Hrh1O3BEEFOuUM/edit)

* **Respect Each & Every One of the MAGFest Community**

    * It's important that we create an inclusive environment for everyoneâ€”volunteers, employees, attendees, and board members alike. Please carry yourself appropriately and treat your colleagues with respect, compassion, and consideration. Slack is not the essential avenue of communication for MAGFest. Remember that staffers arenâ€™t expected or able to always be online.

    * Even if everyone isnâ€™t participating in a conversation, be aware that what you say sets an example for the rest of the community; many are/arenâ€™t reading your words. As a volunteer, you represent MAGFest: this applies to Slack behavior. 

* **Choose Your Words Lovingly**

    * Your actions, online and offline, affect others. Remember that at the end of the day, we all want whatâ€™s best for MAGFest. Sometimes we have different ideas about how to get there, but always strive for collaboration instead of conflict. Itâ€™s okay to disagree as long as itâ€™s not personal. Insults, harassment, and exclusionary languages/behaviors are never acceptable in our community.

* **Consider Other Perspectives**

    * Arguments happen. In the heat of the moment, take a step back and consider other peopleâ€™s perspectives. When tensions are getting heated, reconsider your tone, your intentions, and whether or not the conversation should be paused or taken elsewhere. Strive to constructively resolve conflicts patiently and compassionately. MAGFest is a brilliant organization because we are an eclectic mix of people from all walks of life and professions. 

* **Reasonably Non-Offensive Content**

    * Final decision on this may be made case-by-case by moderators. As per the standard MAGFest [Code of Conduct](http://super.magfest.org/codeofconduct/), try to keep conduct reasonably around a "PG-15" level. 

        * Examples of things that are offensive:

            * Lewd or sexual language

            * Excessive swearing

            * Harassing behavior

            * Discrimination based on sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, color, religion, national origin, age, political affiliation, social aptitude, speech impediments.

    * **Response to Action**

        * If these guidelines are not respected, you may be kicked from a communications channel or removed from the forum entirely for an appropriate amount of time.

    * **Reporting Guidelines:**

        * If someone is violating this Code of Conduct, please ping moderators either privately or publicly. Slack moderators may be contacted via #SlackModeration or @SlackMods. Reports may also be made [through this online form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z9IHY33Q56XlbJeYLSBLarjqEMJ_c8nteQssSI5lQYs/edit) If notified quickly enough, mods may be able to intervene and diffuse the situation while it is ongoing *â€” *even if it appears incidental.

        * You may also e-mail **[mods@magfest.or**g](mailto:mods@magfest.org). MAGFest must remain a welcoming environment for everyone and we are committed to protecting our community. 

        * If it is believed anyone is in physical danger, please notify the appropriate law enforcement channels first if safe to do so. 

        * If mods are not able/available to immediately intervene, please submit a detailed report of the incident(s). All reports are kept confidential to appropriate parties (department heads, security, moderators, employees, and/or BoDâ€”henceforth named "mods") until consent is given. In your report, please try to include:

            * Your contact info

            * Names (online handles, real, or nicknames) of any individuals involved. Please include additional witnesses, if possible.

            * Where and when the incident occurred.

            * Your account of what happened, with screenshotted logs or links if available. 

            * If you believe or suspect this incident is ongoing.

            * Any additional information you think mods should know.

        * After a report is filed, MAGFest mods will notify you acknowledging receipt within 24 hours at the latest.

        * MAGFest mods will review the incident report, make any necessary investigation, and determine:

            * What happened.

            * Whether this event is a code of conduct violation.

            * The severity of the violation if it does violate the code of conduct

            * Whether this is an ongoing situation.

            * If there is a threat to anyoneâ€™s safety.

        * In the event of an ongoing incident and threat to physical safety, MAGFestâ€™s immediate priority is to protect everyone involved. We will encourage those involved to notify appropriate law enforcement channels. MAGFest staff may also notify law enforcement if requested. We may provide a referral to appropriate resources to assist.

        * Once appropriate staff have reviewed a complete account of the events, they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:

            * A reply determining that no violation occurred.

            * A warning to the contributors to de-escalate their language.

            * A kick from the channel.

            * A private reprimand to the individual(s) involved.

            * A request for a public or private apology.

            * A request to engage in reflection and/or mediation.

            * An accountability plan.

            * In extreme cases, a request to find a mentor to work together on the individual(s)â€™ future actions.

            * In extreme cases, a temporary ban from MAGFest events and communication privileges.

            * In extreme cases, removal from a department.

        * Extreme, repeated violations of the Code of Conduct or egregious threats to staffersâ€™ safety may require the case to be escalated to office employees, department heads, event leadership,  BoD, and/or law enforcement. These reports are forwarded to [staffreports@magfest.org](mailto:staffreports@magfest.org), who proceed with an internal investigation. 

        * When MAGFest staff determine the final response, they will contact the original reporter to let them know what action will be taken. The reporter may provide feedback on the response which MAGFest staff may or may not take into account. 

**Staff Directory**

**Consequences**

Failure to follow the Code of Conductâ€™s responsibilities may result in removal from your department(s) and loss of all volunteer benefits. If removed from a department but not an event, it is up to the volunteer to find a new department. It is possible for a volunteer to be banned from staffing one event but not the other depending on event leadershipâ€™s decision.

Volunteers who have consistently violated their responsibilities have remediation options. An individualized plan will be created in conjunction with department heads and, if necessary, office employees. The plan may include any combination of the following options or a unique option not listed below:

1. A watchlist period, where the volunteerâ€™s actions are scrutinized. Incorrect behavior is addressed with the expectation that the volunteer will correct it moving forward. 

2. Enter an agreement with a mentor who is responsible for the actions of the volunteer. The mentor will train the volunteer to correct any negligent behavior. Mentorship must be approved by leadership (e.g. managers, department heads, or event leadership)

3. Conversations with department heads and/or office staff to mediate incorrect behavior.

If a volunteer reneges the Code of Conduct and their individualized plan **three times**, their Staffer eligibility will be revoked.

Egregious violations of the Code of Conduct require immediate and severe punishment including, but not limited to the following options. 

1. Banishment from MAGFest Staff for a period of time or cycle of events.

2. Total removal from MAGFest Staff and attendee eligibility reviewed for revocation.

3. Contacting appropriate channels including law enforcement.

**Reporting Steps:**

If it is believed anyone is in physical danger, please notify the appropriate law enforcement channels first if safe to do so. 

All reports are kept confidential to appropriate parties (department heads, security, moderators, employees, and/or BoD - henceforth named "staff") until consent to share to further personnel is given. In your report, please include:

* If you want to be followed up with directly, your contact info. 

* Names (online handles, real, or nicknames) of any individuals involved. Please include additional witnesses, if possible.

* Where and when the incident occurred.

* Your account of what happened, with screenshotted logs if available. 

* If you believe or suspect this incident is ongoing.

* Any additional information youâ€™d like to include.

 

After a report is filed, MAGFest staff will notify you acknowledging receipt within 24 hours.

MAGFest staff will review the incident report and determine:

* What happened.

* Whether this event is a code of conduct violation.

* The severity of the code of conduct violation.

* Whether this is an ongoing situation.

* If there is a threat to anyoneâ€™s safety.

In the event of an ongoing incident and threat to physical safety, MAGFestâ€™s immediate priority is to protect those involved. We will encourage those involved to notify appropriate law enforcement channels. MAGFest staff may also notify law enforcement if requested. We may provide a referral to appropriate additional resources to assist.

Once appropriate staff have reviewed a complete account of the events, they will make a decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:

* A reply determining that no violation occurred.

* A private reprimand to the individual(s) involved.

* A temporary ban from MAGFest events and communication privileges.

* Removal from a department.

* A request to find a mentor to work together on the individual(s)â€™ future actions.

When MAGFest staff determine the final response, they will contact the original reporter to let them know what action will be taken. The reporter may provide feedback on the response which MAGFest staff may or may not take into account. 

Handling In-Person Reporting:

As a staffer, sometimes people may ask you for help regarding their safety and security. If you are uncomfortable taking an incident report, **do not **feel obliged to continue. Inform your department head and have someone escort the reporter to security.

If someone has chosen to trust you with a report and you feel confident enough to proceed, MAGFest requires you to follow these basic guidelines:

* Refrain from sharing the report to unrelated persons. This includes those who are not involved with the situation or staffers who do not handle reports.

    * Do share the report with security and escalate to appropriate managers, employees, or BoD.

* Make reporting as comfortable of a process as possible:

    * Find a quiet place where you will not be interrupted, ask if they have anywhere specific in mind. If not, ask if theyâ€™re comfortable with any of your ideas.

    * Offer for them to bring a friend for emotional support.

* Ask for help when processing the report:

    * Escalate the report to appropriate managers, employees, and/or committee.

*  Minimize the number of times the reporter needs to repeat the same information: While listening, be sure to record the report via written notes or, with permission, audio recording.

    * If recording, make sure to start with the reporter verbally consenting to being recorded and who they intend the recording to be shared with.

* Reassure the reporter that their concerns are serious, valid, and worthy of action

    * Refrain from downplaying the situation.

* Refrain from promising specific actions.

* Do not pressure reporters for information if they donâ€™t feel comfortable providing it.

* Offer to assist the reporter by contacting further help, but be sure to note that the decision is ultimately theirâ€™s: 

    * staffreports@magfest.org

    * [Phone number for conference security or organizers]

    * [Phone number for hotel/venue security]

    * [Local law enforcement]

    * RAINN (Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network): (202) 544-1034

    * [Local emergency and non-emergency medical (e.g., urgent care, day clinic)]

* Put your personal feelings aside: refrain from judging or questioning the reporterâ€™s reactions. If you are not able to do this, escalate to the appropriate managers, employees, and committee.

After receiving a report, you must inform security to proceed. If this report is received outside of the event, please inform appropriate employees, department heads, and leadership to continue.

Any staffer may issue a verbal warning to a participant whose behavior violates MAGFest's Code of Conduct. Please remember to escalate to security for logging. As soon as practical, please report the warning to [staffreports@magfest.org](mailto:staffreports@magfest.org).

Any reports sent should ideally include:

* the badge number

* the name

* the time of the Code of Conduct violation

* a description of the Code of Conduct violation

* the circumstances surrounding the incident

* other people involved in the incident

Investigating a Report:

A working group of people ("committee") should be formed to investigate reports - it should comprise a mix of board of directors, employees, and event leadership, alongside unbiased volunteer staffers.

Reports generally include the names of witnesses and key actors. Before reaching out for more information, be sure to talk to the reporter. It is important to maintain as much transparency as possible with this process while also sustaining the reporterâ€™s agency:

* Brief them on the investigationâ€™s next steps - who, what, when, where, and how?

    * Examples include: which staffers will be notified and involved in the investigation, who you will collect statements from, when you will be reaching out for statements, how you will gather statements, and an ETA.

    * Always make sure the reporters are comfortable with you proceeding.

* Inform them that during the report follow up, you will reach out to the witnesses for more information

    * Ask them how they feel about this and if theyâ€™re comfortable with you proceeding

* Ask if theyâ€™re comfortable having their identity disclosed:

    * If not, assure them you will not personally disclose, confirm, or deny their identity during the investigation

* Ask what resolution they would like:

    * Do not make any promises and remember that the reporting group determines the final response.

When reaching out for statements from people involved in the incident, briefly explain the situation. Keep in mind your objective for why you are contacting them and maintain a professional, non-judgemental demeanor.

* Explain who you are and how you are associated with MAGFest

* Make sure theyâ€™re comfortable with their report being shared and list who it will be shared with.

* Explain what information you need from them:

    * What did they see?

    * How did they react?

    * Do they have any other information or questions they feel is necessary for the investigation?

* If reaching out via email, be sure to give a preferred deadline.

After compiling statements and information about the incident, evaluate the information and the Code of Conduct violations. Come up with individual recommendations then gather together to discuss what should happen. 

Below are a list of possible resolutions:

* A reply determining that no violation occurred.

* A private reprimand to the individual(s) involved.

* A temporary ban from MAGFest event(s) and communication privileges.

* A permanent ban from MAGFest event(s).

* Removal from a department.

* A request to find a mentor to work together on the individual(s)â€™ future actions.

* A request for a public or private apology.

* An accountability plan.

* A request to engage in mediation.

Once a conclusion is reached, notify the reporter and those affected. You may receive feedback about your conclusion - it is up to the group to decide whether to take the feedback into account or not.
